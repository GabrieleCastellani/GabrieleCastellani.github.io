<p>Oggi mi hanno segnalato questo webcast americano.</p> <p>Appena ho tempo lo seguir√≤ ... nel frattempo lo segnalo a voi se volete darmi feedback sono graditi.</p> <p><a href="http://msevents.microsoft.com/cui/WebCastEventDetails.aspx?culture=en-US&amp;EventID=1032306960&amp;CountryCode=US">http://msevents.microsoft.com/cui/WebCastEventDetails.aspx?culture=en-US&amp;EventID=1032306960&amp;CountryCode=US</a> <p>Description: How can you take advantage of Asynchronous JavaScript and XML (AJAX) in your enterprise Web applications? Which solutions could benefit the most from AJAX capabilities? How does AJAX relate to other solution models like smart clients and traditional Web applications? In this webcast, we address these questions with an overview of ASP.NET code name "Atlas," a free AJAX-based framework from Microsoft. Learn about the capabilities of the "Atlas" framework, and see demonstrations and sample code that illustrate what is involved in implementing an "Atlas"-based solution. We conclude with a look at how "Atlas" compares to other solution models, and recommendations on choosing the best approach for different scenarios.
